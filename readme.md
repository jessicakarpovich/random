## Text Count ##

TextCount (view textCount.py), is for taking in text, saved into text.txt, and counting the number of times each word appears. It reads line by line, removing empty lines, punctuation, and setting all words to be in lowercase. After it is done counting all of the words, the list of words is sorted using the Bubble Sort to have the most often appearing words appear at the beginning.

Currently, the text being used is an excerpt from ["The Lord of the Rings"](https://archive.org/stream/TheLordOfTheRing1TheFellowshipOfTheRing/The%20Lord%20Of%20The%20Ring%201-The%20Fellowship%20Of%20The%20Ring_djvu.txt) by J. R. R. Tolkien.
