## Text Count ##

TextCount (view textCount.py), is for taking in text, and counting the number of times each word appears. It reads line by line, removing empty lines, punctuation, and setting all words to be in lowercase. After it is done counting all of the words, the list of words is sorted using Bubble Sort to have the most often appearing words at the end. Then for each word, the word, word count, and percentage(word count / total word count) is printed. This step usually takes about 8 minutes.

Currently, the text being used is an excerpt from ["The Lord of the Rings"](https://archive.org/stream/TheLordOfTheRing1TheFellowshipOfTheRing/The%20Lord%20Of%20The%20Ring%201-The%20Fellowship%20Of%20The%20Ring_djvu.txt) by J. R. R. Tolkien.
